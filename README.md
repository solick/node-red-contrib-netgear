# node-red-contrib-netgear

Node-RED node collection for communication with Netgear routers using SOAP.

It is based on the module from grujiter: https://github.com/gruijter/netgear.js/ and wraps Node modules around them.

**PLEASE NOTE: It can take up to 10 seconds if the result will be available. This seems a limitation of the SOAP interface, not from Node-RED.**
